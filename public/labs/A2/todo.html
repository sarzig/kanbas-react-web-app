Things that A2 does not do that it needs to do:

* Use Bootstrap breadcrumb feature for course navigation
* Use Bootstrap Collapse feature to implement the menus in Courses Home screen
* Make a robust template 

Courses home
* Needs better "To do" and "Coming Up" area
* Add header for the course details (small plaintext above "Home" Button)
* Better boxes with more line items
* Publish All button should actually drop down
* Publish All button should have less space between it and the down button


Black small screen top bar
* 


Styles.css

* Better grouping of features and buttons and stuff - easier to navigate around
