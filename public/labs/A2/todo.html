Things that A2 does not do that it needs to do:


* Use Bootstrap breadcrumb feature for course navigation
* Use Bootstrap Collapse feature to implement the menus in Courses Home screen
* Make a robust template 


Courses home
* Needs better "To do" and "Coming Up" area
* Add header for the course details (small plaintext above "Home" Button)
* Better boxes with more line items
* Publish All button should actually drop down
* Publish All button should have less space between it and the down button


Black small screen top bar
* make it so buttons can NEVER be vertically stacked (put each in own column?)


Styles.css:
* Better grouping of features and buttons and stuff - easier to navigate around
* Double check with TA if this is an ok document to put high level stuff into?


Assignments:
* Figure out .assignment-round-button better
* Figure out way to make check and ellipsis not overlap
