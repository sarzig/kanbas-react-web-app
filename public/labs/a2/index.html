    <h2>Style attribute and tag</h2>
    <h5>Style attribute: The following paragraph achieves its styling via the <u>style attribute</u>:</h5>
    <p style="
    background-color: #6699FF; 
    color: black;
    text-align: center;
    text-decoration:underline;
    ">
        Style attribute allows configuring look and feel right on the element. <br><br>Although it's very convenient it
        is
        considered bad practice and you should avoid using the style attribute.<br><br>You'll notice that even though
        the header defines a paragraph style, overwriting the paragraph style on this most local level is the one that
        eventually renders.
    </p>

    <h5>Style tag: The following paragraph achieves its styling via the <u>style tag defined in the header</u>:</h5>
    <p>
        A slightly better way to configure look and feel
        is to declare CSS rules in the STYLE tag in the
        header and then refer to the tag by their name,
        ID, or class This paragraph's style is set by a
        rule referring to the P tags.<br><br><u>NOTE: this styling was commented out so we can instead use
            labs/A2/index.css</u>
    </p>

    <h5>Link tag: The following paragraph achieves its styling via the <u>Link tag defined in the header</u>:</h5>
    <p>
        The best way to apply CSS rules is to declare
        them in a separate CSS file and load it with
        the LINK tag. Always use this method.<br><br>The link tag looks like this:<br> &lt;link href="index.css"
        rel="stylesheet"/&gt;
    </p>

    <h5>ID Selector</h5>
    <p id="id-selector-1">Instead of changing the look and feel of all the elements of the same name, e.g., p, we can refer to a specific element by its ID</p>
    <p id="id-selector-2">Here's another paragraph using a different ID and a different look and feel.</p>
    <h5></h5>

    <h5>Class Selector</h5>
