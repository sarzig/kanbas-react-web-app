        This place is a message... and part of a system of messages... pay attention to it! <br>
        Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture. <br>
        
        This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here. <br>
        
        What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger. <br>
        
        The danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center... the center of danger is here... of a particular size and shape, and below us. <br>
        
        The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours. <br>
        
        The danger is to the body, and it can kill. <br>
        
        The form of the danger is an emanation of energy. <br>
        
        The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited. <br>
