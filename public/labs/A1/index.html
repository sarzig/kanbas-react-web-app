    <h2>2.3 Heading Tags - Long-Time Nuclear Waste Warnings</h2>
    <p>
        This place is a message... and part of a system of messages... pay attention to it! <br>
        Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture. <br>

        This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.
        <br>

        What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger. <br>

        The danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center... the center of danger is here... of a
        particular size and shape, and below us. <br>

        The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours. <br>

        The danger is to the body, and it can kill. <br>

        The form of the danger is an emanation of energy. <br>

        The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and
        left uninhabited. <br>

    <h2>2.4 Testing Adding Paragraph Tags</h2>
    <p>
        This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format vertical
        gaps between long pieces of text like this one.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white gap
        between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default browsers render
        them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph tag to
        tell browsers to render the gaps.
    </p>

    <h2>2.5 List Tags</h2>
    <h3>2.5.1 Testing Ordered List Tag</h3>
    The Sandia report further recommended that any such message should comprise four levels of increasing complexity:
    <ol>
        <li>Rudimentary information: "Something man-made is here"</li>
        <li>Cautionary information: "Something man-made is here and it is dangerous"</li>
        <li>Basic information: Tells what, why, when, where, who, and how</li>
        <li>Complex information: Highly detailed written records, tables, figures, graphs, maps and diagrams</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2.5.2 Testing Unordered List Tag</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Landscape of Thorns</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle">A mass of many irregularly-sized spikes protruding from the
            ground in all directions.</li>
        <li>Spike Field</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle">A series of extremely large spikes emerging from the ground
            at different angles.</li>
        <li>Spikes Bursting Through Grid</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle">A large square grid pattern across the site, through which
            large spikes protrude at various angles.</li>
        <li>Menacing Earthworks</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle">Large mounds of earth shaped like lightning bolts,
            emanating from the edges of a square site. The shapes would be strikingly visible from the air, or from
            artificial hills constructed around the site.</li>
        <li>Black Hole</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle">An enormous slab of basalt or black-dyed concrete,
            rendering the land uninhabitable and unfarmable.</li>
        <li>Rubble Landscape</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle">A large square-shaped pile of dynamited rock, which over
            time would still appear anomalous and give a sense of something having been destroyed.</li>
        <li>Forbidding Blocks</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle">A network of hundreds of house-sized stone blocks, dyed
            black and arranged in an irregular square grid, suggesting a network of "streets" which feel ominous and
            lead nowhere. The blocks are intended to make a large area entirely unsuitable for farming or other future
            use.</li>
    </ul>
