// the lambda "remembers" the state. putting deleteElement(index) postpones the invocation
// of the function to the future, once the event happens. 

// because delteElement has a parameter, if we pass a paremeter and don't put it in closure, 
// it will invoke immediately

//add element has no parameter and therefore can be used directly {addElement} in line

// One best practice you could do is ALWAYS use the "closure" (lambda) syntax...xxx sarah I want
// to do this always-works syntax
