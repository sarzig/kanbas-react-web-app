            <ul>
                <li>When a file like ES5Functions.tsx has multiple functions defined, how does that work?</li>
                <li>Should we have maximum one function per tsx file? Are tsx files containing many functions that are closely related?</li>
                <li>What does the "Export default" do?</li>
                <li>What is correct naming convention of tsx files?</li>
                <li>When to use TS vs JS files? How are these two languages related?</li>
            </ul>
